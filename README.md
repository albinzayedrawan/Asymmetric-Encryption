# Asymmetric Encryption

## RSA Encryption and Decryption:
- Write a Python program that performs RSA encryption and decryption using your generated key pair.
- Encrypt the following message: "CRYPTOGRAPHY" (convert each character to its ASCII value).
- Decrypt the ciphertext back to the original message.

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:
- Write a Python program that performs the Diffie-Hellman key exchange using the provided values and private keys for Alice and Bob.
- The program should output both public keys and the shared secret key for both parties.
